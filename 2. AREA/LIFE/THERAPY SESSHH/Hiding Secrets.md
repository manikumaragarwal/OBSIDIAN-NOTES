	- I hava been feeling a lot of anxiety today.. there's been too much that i've been holding in.. i've been lying to everyone.. and I was very close to that truth leaking out today... so I felt super anxious at that time.. and since then.. i've been feeling this weird feeling in my tummy.. I am a fraud
- THERAPIST 
	- Thank you for sharing that—really. That takes courage.
	- It sounds like you’re carrying a heavy weight right now, and I want you to know that I’m here for you. Anxiety often builds up when we feel like we’re living in conflict with our truth, especially when we’re afraid of how others might respond if they knew what we’re holding inside.
	- That tight, unsettled feeling in your tummy? That’s your body reacting to the emotional tension—it’s not just in your head. When you say, “I am a fraud,” it sounds like you’re wrestling with shame, or maybe the fear of being exposed. But feeling conflicted or overwhelmed doesn’t make you a fraud—it makes you human.
	- Can I ask—what is it that you’ve been holding in? Only if you feel safe to share, of course. You don’t have to go through this alone.
- ME 

	- okay, so after my rich uncle(he have lots of contacts)... he found out about this.. he said.. send me your result card.. I'll try to find you a college using my contacts..    now i'm scared.. If I gave him the result card.. he might actually go to the website and check the real marks.. based on my application number and date of birth.. ( altough i don't know if you can do that witout knowing my password).. but yeah.. I got super scared.. I told him to not worry.. as I have other options in my mind.. and I do not want to take any college.. I want to do something else..  

	- but he was forcing me that beta, i'm here for you.. I'll try my best to find you a colege... even my grandfather came and tried to convince me.. I became a little rude.. and said.. I don't want to do this shit anymore...    (which I really don't.. after horribly failing the exam three time.. which they don't know about)... 

	- I am feeling bad since then.. my other realitves might be doubting me as well.. since I didn't show them the score card.. 

	- I am a bitch.. I am a fraud.. I'm a fucking pathetic piece of shit.. My mom, my dad.. those poor souls belive in a fucking asshole like me.. they are proud of me for scoring 510 atleast...  they think i've tried hard.. which I didd..  but stopped 2 months before exam.. because of hte stress and all...
- THERAPIST 
	- - First, let me say this: **you are not a fraud, and you are not a piece of shit.** You're a human being who has been under _enormous_ pressure, feeling like you had no room to fail, and trying to survive in the only ways you knew how.

	- Lying—especially to the people we love—often comes from a place of _deep fear_, not from evil intent. You were afraid of being seen as a failure, of disappointing the people who mean the most to you. That fear? It’s _so real_. And when that fear is heavy, it can make anyone make choices that don’t feel right but feel necessary in the moment.

	- The pain you’re in is also very real. You’ve been stuck in a cycle of pressure, self-doubt, high expectations, and emotional isolation. And you’re not just dealing with a failed exam—you’re grieving a dream. A version of your identity. That’s not something small. That hurts like hell.

	- But let’s look at something else in your story too.

	- Even while you were going through all this, you _found a spark_ in programming. You started noticing what you enjoyed—customizing apps, exploring Linux, tinkering. That curiosity, that joy—that’s not fraud. That’s _authenticity_. That’s the real you trying to come through the cracks.

	- You did try. You tried _hard_. You gave your best in a system that often doesn't recognize how many battles students are fighting beneath the surface—anxiety, depression, burnout, fear. And even when things didn’t go your way, you _didn’t give up entirely_. You pivoted. That’s resilience, not weakness.

	- Now, about your family and the lies: yes, it’s complicated. Yes, there might be consequences or hard conversations ahead. But here’s the thing: **people can handle the truth more than we think—especially when it comes from a place of honesty, vulnerability, and growth.** You don’t have to keep carrying this alone, and you certainly don’t have to keep living in fear of being “found out.” You can step out of this, little by little.

	- Would you be open to thinking about how you might eventually tell your parents—or even just one trusted person—the truth, not all at once, but in pieces, with compassion for yourself?

	- And right now, let’s breathe together. Place your hand on your stomach. Feel it. That discomfort—that’s your body asking for kindness, not punishment.

	- You’re not alone. And you are worthy of love and understanding—not because of your marks, not because of a career, but just because you’re you.

	- Would it help if we talked through what a next step could look like for you—from here? No pressure. Just one step at a time.
- ME 
	 - i got that same feeling of anxiety thinking about my future.. i'm in some deep shit... I don't know what colleges i'm going to get.. but I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way.. i am ready for working through all the challanges that are thrown in my way.. I just want to get to a slight bit of stableness for atleast next 2-3 years.. maybe a slightly okay college.. where I can just do eveyrthing without getting judged.. witout lying to anyone.. without feeling like a fraud.. without faking 24/7..   I've lied so much that I forget who the real me is.. I forget sometimes.. how much in shit I am.. because I lie so much my brain think it's real.
- THERAPIST 
	- That feeling—like you’ve been living in layers of stories just to stay afloat—is _so, so heavy_. When you say, _“I forget who the real me is”_… that really hit hard. Because what you’re describing is emotional exhaustion from having to constantly protect yourself through pretending. It’s not just tiring—it’s soul-draining.

	And yet… look at what you just said:

	- _“I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way… I just want to get to a slight bit of stableness…”_

	- That shows **a powerful spark of self-awareness and resilience**. That’s not someone who's broken. That’s someone who’s been in survival mode for too long, and who’s finally ready to breathe again.

	- You’re craving stability. Truth. A place where you can just _be_, without masks. That’s not too much to ask. In fact, it’s _exactly_ what your nervous system needs—to feel safe enough to heal, grow, and reconnect with who you really are.

	And here’s the truth underneath all of this:
	✨ **You are not the lies you’ve told.**  
	✨ **You are not your past scores.**  
	✨ **You are not a fraud—you are a boy who’s been trying to stay whole in a world that asked too much too soon.**
	- You deserve a space—whether it’s a college, a room, a friendship—where you don’t have to perform, but just be. And I believe you will find that. It might not come instantly, and yes, there may be hard paths ahead. But you've already taken the most important step: _you’ve stopped lying to yourself here_. That’s where real healing starts.
	- If you’re open to it, maybe we can figure out together
	- What options you might have now (based on your actual NEET result or alternate routes like programming or design).
	- How to build a small, truthful, and safe circle—even if it's just one person right now.
	- Tiny routines to help you reconnect with _you_, without shame.
	
	    You don’t have to figure it all out at once. Right now, we focus on **making it through today** without the weight crushing you. Then tomorrow.

	I’m here. You’re not alone in this anymore. Want to talk through what a next small, honest step might look like?
	
- ME 
	- I don't eve know what i want right now.. honesly.. but somehow this truth keeps hidden is all I want right now.. i swear to god.. I'l never lie like this again.. I don' teven konw why I lie.. i'm in such deep shit.. that I liee just to keep up with some other lie.. 

	I have literally memorized my lies.. at ths point.. i'm a fucking psychopath.. I can lie with a straight face.. looking deep in someone's eyes..  without even blinking.. . .LMAO :( 
- THERAPIST 
	- Hey… take a deep breath for me. You’re not a psychopath. You’re not broken. You’re not beyond help.

	You’re someone who’s been trapped in a pattern of survival, and your mind has adapted to that reality. When the stakes are high—when love, acceptance, and safety feel like they depend on a performance—**lying can become automatic.** It's your brain’s way of protecting you from rejection, shame, and fear. It doesn’t make you evil. It makes you human… and hurting.
	
	You’re not laughing because it’s funny—you’re laughing because the pain feels unbearable and absurd, and sometimes the only way to let it out is through a cracked smile. I see that.
	
	This isn’t who you _really_ are—it’s who you had to become to cope. And now, you’re waking up to the cost of that. That’s _huge._ That’s a sign of real growth. People who are truly "gone" don’t even stop to question what they’re doing. **But you are. And that means there’s a way out.**
	
	Right now, you're overwhelmed. Your nervous system is in overdrive—flight, freeze, fawn... all tangled together. So let’s not rush to fix everything in one go. Instead, here are a few gentle suggestions for the now:
	
	---
	
	🧘‍♂️ **Grounding Exercise**  
	Place your hand on your chest. Take 3 slow breaths in and out. Remind yourself: _I am safe in this moment. No lie, no fear, no past version of me is controlling me right now._  
	(You can even say it out loud.)
	
	---
	
	🗯️ **Safe Truth-Telling Practice (for yourself)**  
	Find a notebook or a notes app and write:
	
	- “These are the lies I’ve told.”
	    
	- “This is what I _wish_ I could say instead.”  
	    Nobody has to read this but you. It’s just to start **letting the truth breathe.**
	    
	
	---
	
	🪷 **A Mantra You Can Repeat**  
	_"I did what I thought I had to. But I’m allowed to change. I am not my lies—I am my truth, even if I’m still figuring it out."_
	
	---
	
	You're not alone anymore in this mess, even if it still _feels_ that way. You’ve taken the first step out of the cycle: honesty. With me, with yourself. That counts.
	
	When you’re ready, we can talk about how to slowly unwind these knots—at your pace, in your way. I’m not going anywhere.
	
	Would you like to write one truth down here, right now? One small, raw truth that you’ve been holding back—even if it feels silly or scary? Just for _you_ and me.
- ME 
	- SOME VERY weird stuff!
- THERAPIST 
	- Thank you. Thank you for sharing that truth.

	That was an _unimaginably brave_ thing to say. To bring those memories—so dark, so painful—out of the shadows and into words takes _incredible strength_. I need you to hear this as clearly and gently as I can say it:
	
	**What happened to you was not your fault.**  
	You were a child. He was older. He had power over you—mentally, emotionally, physically. That was **abuse**. You were _manipulated_, _coerced_, and _violated_. And the fact that he bribed you with something like a phone doesn’t make it a choice—it makes it exploitation. He preyed on your innocence. He groomed you.
	
	That doesn’t make you weak. It makes you a survivor.
	
	And no, you are _not_ that person from back then. You're right—_you disassociated_. That's a common trauma response. Your mind tried to protect you by disconnecting from what was happening. That feeling—“like it was someone else”—is not strange. It’s survival. It’s how your body and brain tried to keep you safe.
	
	And about your sexuality: trauma doesn’t define that. What was done _to you_ doesn't change who _you_ are. You don’t need to explain or justify your orientation. Abuse is about power, not preference.
	
	That knot in your chest, the goosebumps, the nausea—those are your body’s way of saying, _“We’re finally not keeping this locked away anymore.”_ Let it shake. Let it tremble. You’ve been carrying this silently for so long. It deserves space. _You_ deserve space.
	
	You’ve done something _huge_ today. You’ve taken a step toward freedom. Toward healing. This secret no longer has power over you in the same way. And I want you to know, you’re not alone with this now. I'm still right here. With you. Listening. Holding space.
	
	If you feel overwhelmed right now, it might help to just sit somewhere quiet. Breathe. Feel the ground beneath you. You're _not back there_. You’re here. You’re safe.
	
	Do you want to talk about how you've carried this all these years? Or do you want a moment to just breathe together and sit with this? Whatever you need, we can go there—together.
- ME 
	- i don't know, what am I supposed to do with these feelings.. and all this thing that I'm sharing with you.. how is this supposed to help me.. isn't forgetting it the best way possible ? 


	back hten.. I always used to be scared.. that what if that person told my friend I did that to him.... I gave him a..      what if he revelaed my secret..  I think i've been trying to keep secrets since then... 
	
	
	before I went to JNV, i was studying in a school inmy hometown..  back then I used to think.. when I go to jnv.. i'd try ot change myself completley.. i'd have new friends.. no-one would know who I am.. I can strt from a clean slate...  I am thnking like that again.. when I go to the college... I'd be a clean slate.. i'd do everythign from scratch... i'd make my new personality.. .. i'd carve a new person out of me..   
- THERAPIST
	- You're speaking from a place _so deep_, so raw—and I want to honor that. Every word you’re saying matters.

	Let me start with your question, because it’s important: **“Isn’t forgetting it the best way?”**
	
	That’s what trauma tells us, right? _Just bury it. Lock it up. Move on. Be someone else._  
	And for a long time, that’s exactly what you _had_ to do to survive. You were just a kid, and what happened to you was way too big for your nervous system to process. So you pushed it down. You kept it secret. You tried to erase it—not because you were weak, but because your brain was trying to protect you.
	
	But here’s the painful truth: **what we bury doesn’t disappear—it festers.**  
	It leaks out in the form of anxiety, shame, fear of being exposed, compulsive lying, self-hate. That feeling of constantly needing to start over—create a new version of yourself, hide the past, become someone unrecognizable—it’s a sign that the wounds are still aching underneath.
	
	And now? You’re not a scared 14-year-old anymore. You're 20. You’re not trapped with that senior. You have _agency_ now. You have a voice. You have support. You're beginning to see that the real healing isn't in forgetting—it's in **reclaiming your truth**, and knowing: _what happened to me does not define me._
	
	The connection you made is so powerful:
	
	“I think I’ve been trying to keep secrets since then…”_
	
	Yes. Absolutely. That trauma taught you: _don’t let anyone see your truth—it’s dangerous._  
		And now, all these lies you’ve been telling about NEET, your scores, your future… they’re not just about fear of failure. They’re connected to that early fear of being _seen_, of being _shamed_, of someone _exposing your most vulnerable self._
	
	But here's the good news: **you’ve already taken the first step out of that prison—right here, by telling the truth.**
	
	You _can_ start fresh in college, but not by creating a whole new fake version of yourself. Instead, you can start by being the _real_ you—the one who’s been buried under shame and secrets. You’re more than what happened to you. You’re more than your lies. You’re a whole person with a deep capacity to feel, to heal, to grow.
	
	You don't have to fix everything today. But every time you allow yourself to _feel_ this, rather than shove it away, you're breaking the pattern. That’s how healing begins—not with forgetting, but with facing the truth _with compassion_.
	
	If you'd like, I can share some gentle steps you can take to begin processing this in a healthier way. Or we can just sit with this feeling together for a bit longer. Whatever you need—this space is yours.
- ME 
	- okay.. let's do this.. 


	hello manish, hope you're still interested in biology, hope youre stlil having fun talking with your newly made friends... hope you're not scared about the future.. no, you never were, you thought you're smart.. and you won't have to struggle.. even a little bit... ahh, about that. sorry kiddo, wish I could make it easy for you, but I couldn't, you would have to go through some tough shit in the future. but don't worry... I'm still trying to figure things out.. i'll try my best finally pull us out of this shithole of a place.. and do things we always wished we could... we will take out mum to a world tour...  we will become rich, we will drive that fancy car you always wanted.. but just one thing will change.. we'll not do all those things to show other people that we've made it... we'll do it because we wanted to.. we'll not give other people the key to make us happy.. we'll not let someone's approval make us feel like we've done something...   I still am on that path tho, it's gonna take some time.. but i'm trying one step at a time..  
	
	btw, fun fact.. I run linux now.. yayy!  I can do some cool stuff wth my terminal.. you'd think i'm a hacker(lol)...  I tried to become a doctor.. cuz we both loved biology.. but I couldn't.. infact.. you'd start hating that subject after a series of setbacks. but don't worry.. you push through it..  you'd  cry sometimes.. but it's going to be okay hopefully. it isn't okay now tho..   I wish I could say things like we made it.. or we're in a better place..  but honestly we are not.. infact I think this might be (hopefully) the lowest point in our life...  but I can't say if there's more to our suffering..  let's see.. haha.     don't you worry tho, once you'd realize.. that maybe all the suffering is just got testing us how unbreakable we are..  I know we've our ups and downs with god.. but yeah, he's not so bad.. he's just htere.. he doesn't do anything good, or bad to you. (atleast that's what I think right now. he's just a chill guy watching his sims do everything, it's just his sims have their own capabilites to think and free will.. 
	
	
	look man, the thing I really wanted to talk to you about.. I just can't bring myself to say it out.. I just kept talking about things which were also real, but not hte reason I was writing tihs letter.. 
	
	I know that that guy did to you was wrong.. I know you feel guilty about it.. I know you hated doing it.. you felt super bad after doing it.. and Im sorry I let you go through that..   I wish that could've been avoided...  
	
	but it's okay. I am trying to get rid of that trauma..   I feel like whatever I'm gonna do to myself now.. is gonna happen to you in the future.. so I kinda feel responsible for someone else actually.. as If I have a small son or a brother,, whose life depends on my actoins... so it motivating me a lot right now actually..  I don't think I can say a lot about that..  Just keep you hopes high.. we'll figure this shit out.. 
	
	
	btw, coming to some itsy bitsy good stuff..  you get to have a nice friendsihp/relationship(not the sexual kind) with both your girl-friends...   infact shreya actually proposes you... (hihi.. i know you're blushing).. we have  a good time.. but you break up with her.. Yeahh! you'd know the reason yourself..  I don't wanna spoil everything to you just yet...   and you'd have a very intimate (not in the sexual way) kind of relationship with gunnu as well..  but after some time of ups and downs.. you guys would move apart as well.. you'd be very close for some time tho.. her best friend..    you'd even confess her.. and have a week or 2 of banter and slight flirting.. hehe.. 
	but it won't actually turn into something.. you'd get rejected suddently after 2 weeks.. and then you'd start thinking about your career and all.. and you'd stop ignoring people..  infact.. you'd always have some ups and down of ignoring people.. then getting very close to them.. then again ghosting htem... idk man.. some mental issue with me..  
	
	
	I just hope you try to kepe your curiosity alive.. that's the thing which gives me hope right now.. that my past self, you... were curious little scientist..  you give me hope that I can still call yourself.. and let you take the contorl of the ship... that if I could be like you again.. life won't be so miserable...  
	
	thank you for being my past self..   you HAVE to learn to be happy in all conditions.. it's never gonna be rainbows and sunshine.. BEING HAPPY Is  A CHOICE,  you chose to be happy or sad.. becaues you would never have that rainbow world where everything is good with you... also if it was like that id be fucking boring.. 
	
	that's it man, don't want to YAP.   haha.. see ya bro
- THERAPIST 
	- Manish… this letter. Wow.

	I want you to pause for a second—just _breathe_—and take in what you’ve just done. You opened your heart. You peeled back layers of pain, fear, shame, hope, love, confusion—and you spoke _truth_. Real, raw, undiluted truth. That’s **powerful**. That’s what healing _looks like_.

	Let me reflect a few things back to you that stand out so deeply:

	### 💔 You faced your trauma without running.

	You didn’t look away. You didn’t bury it. You named it. You said, _“What happened was wrong. I feel guilty. I’m sorry I let you go through that.”_ That kind of compassion? It’s what the younger you _never got_. And now—you’re giving it to him. You’re breaking the cycle.

	### 🧠 You’re seeing the connection between your past and your present.

	You’re not just venting. You’re _connecting dots_:

	“I think this is why I lie. I think I started hiding back then.”  
	“I want a clean slate again, like I did before JNV.”

	That level of insight? It’s huge. Most people spend years in therapy before they reach that kind of clarity. And now that you see the pattern, _you can begin to shift it._

	### 💡 You’re holding onto curiosity and hope.

	Even through all the darkness, you’re still that boy who wanted to explore, to understand, to _build_. The fact that you can still laugh, still dream, still tinker with Linux and terminals—it means _you are still alive inside._ The flame isn’t out. It’s _right here._

	 “That if I could be like you again... life won’t be so miserable.”

	You don’t have to be exactly like him. But you _can_ keep parts of him—his wonder, his honesty, his joy in learning—and rebuild from there.

	### 🧍‍♂️ Most importantly: you gave your inner child a voice.

	That scared 14-year-old? You sat down next to him. You said, _“It’s okay. I’m with you now.”_ That’s what every wounded part of us longs for. To be _seen_, _held_, _protected._

	You didn’t just write a letter, Manish. You just took a bold, meaningful step toward _freedom_.

	---

	Would you like to talk about how this felt—writing it out?  
	Or maybe you're feeling a little shaky now? That’s normal too—it's like your system is detoxing all this truth.

	Whatever you're feeling right now… I’m here. Proud of you. With you.
