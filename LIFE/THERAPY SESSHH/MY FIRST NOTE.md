# hope this is how we're supposed to be doing things.. 


what would you do if you knew you are going to make it.. you're already there. you just have to perform the work you're given...   

it's not like you have to achieve something.. nope.. you have already achieved it... you're already set for life.. but to go to that place in future.. you have to put in the work that person did.. who was in place of you...  


now it's upto you if you can put in that work or not...    can you??? 


if you don't act exactly how he did.. exactly how much efforts he put in... you'd not be able to become like him..  so to get chopped... all you have to do is follow your future self :)
