Sure-Shot way of bagging an internship during College (by a DU Ranker) Part 1/3

1. Field Of Interest :
Firstly decide the fields you are interested in- lets say, I am into Marketing & Advertising + Entrepreneurship in general- but no work ex. (If you do not have even the slighest bit of idea ki kya karna hai- go with something that even slightly interests you/academic field related - make it your purpose to explore them & figure out what works along the process)

2. Assess the Market:
Make a list of Top Companies/Brands in that field of interest - eg. Schbang, Ogilvy, Talented etc for Advertising & Marketing + Startups (Top ones like Zomato to the budding ones like Fire In The Belly (FTB)- so basically a Range & have options of startups for 1-10 & 0-1 phases : both have its own learnings). 
Also, make a list of all the Top influencers + experts in that field. (Eg. Devargh Mukherjee, Bo Dasgupta, Shubman Gune etc for Advertising & Marketing)
<we will visit this step again, once we are ready to apply>


3. Proof of Work
- Build Real proof of work (If you had work ex- compile them & build a strong portfolio- which speaks you)
- Spec Work (Great addition, specially if you do not have work ex. Lets say, I want to work in Marketing- So I ll pick up some of my fav brands & build spec ads i.e "If I were making it fot real- I would make it like that" - and compile it into a portfolio.) (TIP: POST ON LINKEDIN & TAG the brand + all those field experts (politely looking for feedback + showing people what work you are capable of)

Read Part 2 for next step. Feel free to shoot queries if you have any- for the above mentioned.
