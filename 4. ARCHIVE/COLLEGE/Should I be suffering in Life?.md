So, I was watching this interview of PW today and there was a guy who used to work in an apple field while preparing for NEET at the same time.

For the last 12 years, he's only been sleeping for 3 hours a day. The rest of the time was spent on studying or working to survive.

After hearing his insane story, I started feeling really anxious and even got chills down my spine.

Now I'm totally confused and anxious. If you want to achieve something great in life, would you ever be able to surpass this man who has literally suffered during his teenage years more than you ever will in your whole life?

- would I ever be able to surpass this man in the future?
- Does you need to suffer if you want to achieve something transcendent?
- If your life is going smoothly, is it your fault? Is it your fault that you weren’t dealt with a shitty life?
- Now can someone, who has a pretty average childhood, with no suffering, nothing cool to make your story sound like an protagonist biography, actually achieve greatness?

### Now, here are some of the observations, I have come up with.

<aside> 💲 According to one report, nearly **68%** of the world’s richest people are **self-made**, while 23.7% had a combination of inherited and self-created wealth. [Only 8.5% of global high-net-worth individuals were categorized as having completely inherited their wealth](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/majority-of-the-worlds-richest-people-are-self-made-says-new-report.html)

</aside>

<aside> 💵 Many of the Billionaires were dealt with the shitty hand in their childhood, some of the famous examples, about whom I know are:

1. **Oprah Winfrey-** T.V host + actress + producer
2. **J.K Rowling -** Writer + Director
3. **Howard Schultz -** CEO of Starbucks
4. **Leonardo Di Caprio -** WELL EVERYONE KNOW WHO LEO IS :) </aside>

I the end, I’m left completely confused, I don’t know what was the outcome of this overthinking session.

But I can say one thing- _Whatever I takes, I’m Ready._
