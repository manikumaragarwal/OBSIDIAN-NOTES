**Dear Shreya,**

As one year settles into memory and another begins, I find myself thinking about the people who have remained steady in my life. The ones who stayed without needing reasons, without asking to be repaid. You are one of those people, and I wanted to tell you this as the year turns.

You have always had a quiet way of being present. Not by filling the space, but by holding it. You listen in a way that makes words feel lighter once they are spoken. There were moments when we barely spoke, when all that existed was your presence on the other end of a call, and somehow that felt like comfort enough. Some people soothe by speaking. You soothe simply by being there.

There were times when I went silent. Times when I took days to return a call, when I withdrew without explanation. And still, you met me with understanding. No anger, no hurt disguised as questions. You seemed to know that silence can sometimes be a language of its own. That kind of patience stays with a person. I carry it with me.

I think often about how freely you offered care, especially during phases when I was struggling to hold myself together. You checked in, not because you had to, but because you chose to. Just to ask how life was treating me, just to remind me that I was not invisible. That kind of kindness does not ask for anything back, and that makes it rare.

I am different now in many ways. More honest. Still figuring things out. A little more careful with words, a little more aware of people. Yet somewhere beneath all of this, there is still the same person who feels safest with those who allow him to be imperfect and unguarded. You have always done that for me. You have always been a constant.

As this new year begins, I wish you a life filled with love and peace, because I have seen how much of both you give to others. I wish you growth, because I have seen your effort, your sincerity, your quiet strength. I hope the world meets you with the same gentleness that you offer so naturally.

I want you to know this, without hesitation or exaggeration. You are amazing, and you deserve every bit of happiness that comes your way. Do not ever let the world dull the charm you carry so effortlessly. You are enough, exactly as you are, and always have been.

Thank you for your presence in my life. Thank you for the calm, for the understanding, for the quiet care that never asked to be noticed.

Wishing you a beautiful year ahead.  
**Manish**
