Subject: Sincere Apology for Non-Submission of VAC Assignment and Request for Reconsideration

Respected Sir,

We, the students of **B.A English (H), first semseter**, are writing this letter with deep regret and sincere apology for failing to submit our VAC essay assignment and missing the viva. We understand the seriousness of our mistake and take full responsibility for not meeting the requirements of the course.

First and foremost, we want to apologize for our lack of involvement and approachability throughout the semester. As a class, we are genuinely ashamed that we did not make enough effort to reach out, ask questions, or seek clarification when we should have. We realize now that we should have been more proactive in our communication with both of you, regardless of the circumstances.

We also acknowledge that there was a communication gap between us as students and you as our teachers. While we understand that the assignment details were communicated online, we failed to give it the attention and seriousness it deserved. This was our mistake. We should have checked our online notifications more regularly and followed up with you in person if we had any doubts. We deeply regret not taking the initiative to connect with you on campus and clarify our responsibilities.

We want to make it clear that we do not fall into the category of students who are disinterested in their subjects. We have always participated actively in our classes, and we genuinely love literature and everything this course has to offer. Our failure to submit the assignment does not reflect our interest or dedication to the subject. It reflects our confusion and poor planning as first year students who are still learning to manage our academic responsibilities.

As first year students, we have been navigating a lot of new challenges this semester. We were confused about many things, including how to balance different courses and manage deadlines. However, we understand that this is not an excuse. Many of our peers managed their work properly, and we should have done the same. We failed to prioritize this assignment, and for that, we are truly sorry.

We are writing to you today to humbly request a chance to resubmit our essay assignment and appear for the viva, even if it means accepting a penalty or reduced marks. We do not want to receive a zero in this subject, not because we are trying to avoid the consequences of our mistake, but because we genuinely care about this course and want to demonstrate our learning and understanding. This is our first year, and we are committed to ensuring that this will be our first and last mistake of this nature.

We understand if you are disappointed in us. We are disappointed in ourselves as well. But we promise that if given this opportunity, we will submit quality work that reflects our true interest and capability in the subject. We will also make every effort to be more responsible, communicative, and engaged for the remainder of our academic journey.

We hope you will consider our request with kindness and give us one more chance to prove ourselves. We are ready to accept any conditions you may set and will be grateful for your understanding.

Thank you for taking the time to read our letter. We look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely,
