### 🧠 **Your Learning Roadmap Based on the Game Plan**
---

## 🧱 **Core Concepts You’ve Already Touched:**

| Skill                                      | Example You’ve Seen             | Status |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------ |
| Selecting elements (`querySelector`, etc.) | `document.querySelector()`      | ✅     |
| Creating elements (`createElement`)        | `document.createElement("div")` | ✅     |
| Styling with JS (`style`, `setAttribute`)  | `el.style.color = "red"`        | ✅     |
| Appending elements (`appendChild`)         | `parent.appendChild(child)`     | ✅     |

We'll build more on these as you go.

## 🔄 **DOM Flow & Conditional Rendering (Pre-Game Screens)**

You’ll need to learn:

- Showing/hiding sections dynamically (like switching from `div-1` to `div-2`)
- Creating inputs based on user number (looped DOM creation)
- Saving form data (names, values)
- Input validation

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> Create a dynamic RSVP form — ask how many friends are coming, then generate input fields for their names.

---

## ✏️ **Form Handling & Data Storage**

Learn:

- How to capture form input values with `.value`
- How to store them (maybe in arrays or objects)
- How to use the data later (like showing names on the game screen)

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> Build a “Save your grocery list” tool — dynamically add items, store them, and print a summary.

---

## ⚙️ **Dynamic List Generation (Truth & Dare Section)**

You’ll need:

- “Add another” functionality (e.g., click ➕ to create another input)
- Storing values in an array
- Randomly picking one later

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> A simple “add your favorite movies” tool, then randomly pick one as “what to watch tonight?”

---

## 🔢 **Random Number Generation & Game Logic**

You’ll need to:

- Generate a random number between two bounds
- Compare player guesses to the number
- Determine the closest guess
- Track which round is ongoing

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> “Guess the magic number” game between 2–3 players; winner is the one closest to the actual number.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Dynamic Layouts (Players on Left & Right)**

Learn:

- How to split player elements into 2 columns
- Assign players alternately (e.g., even index left, odd index right)
- Keep UI organized using `Flexbox` or `CSS Grid`

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> A team allocation visualizer — input names, divide them into 2 groups, and display them side-by-side.

---

## 🧮 **Ranking & Sorting**

Learn:

- How to calculate the difference from the target number
- Sort guesses by accuracy
- Show who came closest

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> A “Who got the closest?” game — enter numbers, and display a leaderboard.

---

## 🔁 **Game Looping / Round Tracking**

You’ll need:

- Store how many rounds are left
- Track round number
- Reset inputs and screens for each round
- End game after final round

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> A 3-round quiz game — show different questions in each round, then end with a score screen.

---

## 🔄 **Component Reusability & Clean Resetting**

Learn:

- Clearing DOM elements (`innerHTML`, `remove()`)
- Rebuilding parts of UI as needed
- Making reusable UI functions

---

## 🎨 **Polishing the UI**

Learn:

- How to style sections for game feel
- Use of classes and `classList.add/remove` for toggling
- Animations or transitions (optional)

🎯 Mini-Project Idea:

> Build a simple “Start Game” screen that fades into the game zone.

### 🧭 Summary of Concepts in Order:

1. Showing/hiding sections
2. Creating multiple inputs dynamically
3. Handling forms and storing values
4. Adding/removing input fields on the fly
5. Random number generation & comparisons
6. Basic array sorting and ranking
7. Game loop with round tracking
8. UI layout with CSS (left/right alignment)
9. Reusability and dynamic DOM cleanup
10. Random truth/dare selection

If you’re ready, I can pick **lesson #1** — dynamic section switching — and teach it with a fun unrelated project like a multi-step feedback form.
