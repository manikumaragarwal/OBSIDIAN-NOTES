- Making things easier ->  break them into categories
	- taking a continua and breakthing them into categories
	- It makes storing information easier .   e.g -> rainbow continua (broken into VIBGYOR)
- Problem with **==categorical thinking==** ? 
	- we overestimate how different two things are.. 
		- eg : scoring 74% v/s scoring 75%
	- we underestimate how different two things might
	- you loose the big picture

The lecture introduces a course on Human Behavioural Biology (BIO 150), which aims to understand the *intricate connections between human physiology and behaviour*.

**1. Opening Scenario: The Unpredictable Man** The lecture begins with a scenario of a 40-year-old man leading a normal life who, out of character, punches a colleague, has an affair with a 16-year-old, and embezzles money. Three possibilities are offered: he's a deep creep, having a midlife crisis, or has a mutation in one gene in his head. The lecture suggests the latter is the case, aligning with profiles of certain neurological diseases caused by a single gene being "out of whack".

**2. Challenging Preconceptions** The lecturer engages the audience with questions about the biological basis of various human traits and beliefs, aiming to highlight the complexity of the subject and introduce the course's nuanced approach:

- **Genetic influence**: On sexual orientation, levels of aggression (sex difference), and intelligence (sex difference).
- **Prenatal events**: Influencing political opinions 30 years later.
- **Biology and religion**: Valid ways of using biology to understand who is religious.
- **Beliefs**: In God, souls, evil, and free will.
- **Nature vs. Nurture**: The preferred view is a "magnificent, fascinating, nuanced interaction".

**3. Four Examples of Behaviour Explained in Courts of Law** The lecture presents four seemingly unrelated circumstances that have been successfully used in courts of law to explain a murderer's behaviour, illustrating how internal biological states can influence actions:

- **Having one's period**: It has been argued in court that a woman's menstrual cycle influenced her aggression, leading to exoneration in some murder cases. Studies show a disproportionate share of female aggression occurs around menses.
- **Having a brain tumour**: Tumours in the amygdala, a brain area linked to aggression and fear, can cause uncontrollably violent behaviour, which has been successfully used as a defence in court.
- **Eating a lot of junk food ("Twinkie Defense")**: Dan White, who assassinated the mayor of San Francisco and Harvey Milk, successfully used the argument that his junk food addiction caused wild fluctuations in blood sugar levels, leading to his actions.
- **Taking anabolic steroids**: Numerous cases of uncontrolled violence have been attributed to the abusive use of anabolic steroids by weightlifters.

**4. Two Critical Points of the Course** These examples lead to the two fundamental tenets of the course:

- **Body Influences Brain**: Sometimes, what is happening in your body can dramatically influence what goes on in your brain.
- **Head Influences Body**: Sometimes, what is going on in your head will affect every single outpost in your body. The course is fundamentally about the **intertwining and interconnections between physiology and behaviour**, including emotions, thoughts, and memories, and how each can deeply influence the other.

**5. The Challenge of Understanding Human Behaviour** Understanding human behaviour, especially complex social and abnormal behaviour, is described as a "huge, messy process" because it is "officially complicated".

**6. The Problem with Categorical Thinking** Humans cope with messy problems by thinking in categories, breaking continua into distinct labels (e.g., line length, mile running speed, colours, shapes, sounds).

- **Benefit**: This strategy makes it easier to store and evaluate information.
- **Dangers**:
    - **Underestimating differences within a category**: When facts fall into the same category, it's hard to differentiate them (e.g., a "B" and "P" sound in Finnish, leading to confusion between "bear" and "apple" for a testicular biopsy practice example).
    - **Overestimating differences across a boundary**: A small difference becomes dramatically significant if it crosses a categorical boundary (e.g., 65 vs. 66 on a test due to a pass/fail line).
    - **Not seeing the big picture**: Focusing too much on categories can obscure the overall context (e.g., disrupting the standard phone number pattern of 3+4 digits makes it hard to remember; looking for specific categories like subway stops to solve a number sequence).

**7. Course Goal: Resisting Categorical Thinking in Biology** The primary goal of the course is to **avoid thinking categorically** about the biology of behaviour.

- **Critique of "Buckets"**: Explanations often fall into "buckets" like endocrinology, anatomy, or evolutionary biology. This leads to problems like underestimating similarities, overemphasising differences, and focusing too much on one's "bucket," claiming it explains everything (e.g., a gene, a neurotransmitter, a childhood trauma).
- **Integrated Approach**: The course will continually examine how what happens in the body influences behaviour, emotions, and memories, and vice-versa, resisting the urge to find a single, isolated explanation.
- **Explaining Behaviour**: For each behavioural category, the course will explore its appearance, immediate neural activity, sensory triggers, hormonal influences, early development, genetic makeup, and evolutionary pressures.
- **Temporary Platforms, Not Buckets**: Each level of explanation (hormones, genes, environment) is just a "temporary platform" or a convenient way to describe the outcome of all prior influences, going back to millennia of evolution. There are "no buckets" in this integrated view.

**8. Dangers of Pathological Categorical Thinking** The lecture highlights historical examples of influential scientists who, by adhering rigidly to categorical thinking, caused immense damage:

- **John Watson (Behaviourism)**: A founding father of behaviourism (early 20th century), believed he could train any child to be anything (doctor, lawyer, beggar, thief) by controlling their environment and rewards/punishments. This view is now understood to be pathologically limited, as biological factors like protein malnutrition can undermine such control.
- **Egas Moniz (Frontal Lobotomies)**: A Portuguese neurologist who invented frontal lobotomies, believing "synaptic adjustments" could cure mental disorders with "no failures". This led to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of healthy brains and is considered a "dark chapter" in psychiatry. He received a Nobel Prize for it.
- **Konrad Lorenz (Ethology/Nazi Propagandist)**: A founding father of ethology, known for discovering imprinting in birds, also became a "rabid Nazi propagandist". He advocated for "extermination of elements of the population loaded with dregs" based on flawed "racial ideas," leading to the deaths of millions.

**9. Three Intellectual Challenges in Human Behavioural Biology** When studying human behaviour, there are three types of circumstances to consider:

- **Humans are just like other animals**: Recognising situations where humans behave identically to other species (e.g., menstrual/ovulatory synchrony, known as the "Wellesley Effect" in humans, which operates via pheromones similar to hamsters, goats, and pigs).
- **Similar physiology, different use**: Humans possess typical, "boring" physiology but use it in profoundly unique ways not seen in other animals (e.g., chess grandmasters exhibiting marathon-runner blood pressure just by thinking; experiencing stress from abstract concepts like mortality, economic inadequacy from seeing a car, or fictional events; feeling compassion for distant strangers or other species).
- **Unique human behaviour**: Circumstances where human actions have no remote parallel in the animal kingdom (e.g., non-reproductive sex day after day, talking about sex, confusing sexuality with aggression, and language use).

**10. Course Structure and Logistics**

- **First Half**: Will introduce the "buckets" or categories of biological study relevant to behaviour: evolutionary theory, molecular genetics, behavioural genetics, ethology, the brain, and endocrinology. This part is described as "dizzying" due to frequent topic shifts.
- **Second Half**: Will dismantle these "buckets" by applying the integrated approach to specific behaviours such as sexual behaviour, aggression, parental behaviour, schizophrenia, depression, personality disorders, and language use.
- **No Prerequisites**: The course is designed for students with no prior background, as behavioural biology is considered essential for everyone (e.g., for jury service, voting, understanding family members with depression).
- **Catchup Sections**: Weekly additional sections are offered for students without background in specific areas to get up to speed.
- **Assessments**: There will be a midterm and a final exam.
    - **Midterm**: Scheduled for **Monday, May 3rd, at 7:30 PM**. It will focus on understanding the basics of each "bucket" or discipline, with some interdisciplinary thinking.
    - **Final**: Scheduled for **June 4th, at 12:15 PM**. It will be entirely focused on forcing students to think across disciplines.
    - Both exams will largely consist of multiple-choice questions due to the large class size.
- **Reading Materials**:
    - **"Chaos" by James Gleick**: This book introduces a "radically different way of thinking about biology," arguing that behaviour is like a cloud, not a clock, challenging reductionism.
    - The lecturer's own book will be relevant for the second half of the course.
    - Assigned readings will primarily be online papers to download.
- **Online Resources**: Handouts, lecture notes (for the first half), commonly asked questions, Q&A, logistics, and some slides will be available on the Coursework platform. Lectures will be taped and posted online, usually within a day or so.
- **Teaching Assistants (TAs)**: A team of TAs will lead weekly sections (regular and advanced) and hold office hours, providing expert support.
- **Units**: The class is **five units**, reflecting the heavy class time commitment.
