### BIO 150: Human Behavioural Biology – Lecture Notes

This course, BIO 150 (also known as Bio 250 or Hum Bio 160, with no difference in requirements or units), aims to understand the intricate connections between human physiology and behaviour .

#### 1. Challenging Preconceptions & The Complexity of Behaviour

The lecture opens by presenting a scenario of a man exhibiting out-of-character behaviour (e.g., punching a colleague, an affair, embezzlement) and suggests this could be due to a single gene mutation. This sets the stage for exploring the biological basis of traits like sexual orientation, aggression, and intelligence, as well as the influence of prenatal events on later opinions. The preferred view on "nature vs. nurture" is a "magnificent, fascinating, nuanced interaction" [i]. Understanding human behaviour is described as a "huge, messy process" because it is "officially complicated" [i].

#### 2. The Body-Brain Interconnection: Courtroom Examples

The lecture illustrates how internal biological states can dramatically influence behaviour by citing four circumstances successfully used in courts of law to explain a murderer's actions:

- **Menstrual Cycle**: A woman's period has been argued to influence aggression, leading to exoneration in some murder cases, with studies showing disproportionate female aggression around menses [i].
- **Brain Tumour**: Tumours in the amygdala (linked to aggression and fear) can cause uncontrollable violence, used as a successful defence [i].
- **Junk Food Addiction ("Twinkie Defense")**: Wild fluctuations in blood sugar due to junk food were successfully argued to have influenced actions [i].
- **Anabolic Steroids**: Numerous cases of uncontrolled violence have been attributed to steroid abuse [i].

##### These examples highlight the two critical points of the course [i]:

- **Body Influences Brain**: What happens in your body can dramatically influence your brain.
- **Head Influences Body**: What goes on in your head will affect every outpost in your body. The course fundamentally explores the **intertwining and interconnections between physiology and behaviour**, including emotions, thoughts, and memories, and how each can deeply influence the other [i].

#### 3. The Problem with Categorical Thinking

Humans tend to cope with messy problems by thinking in categories, which helps store and evaluate information [i]. However, this strategy carries dangers [i]:

- **Underestimating differences within a category** [i].
- **Overestimating differences across a boundary** [i].
- **Not seeing the big picture** [i].

The **primary goal of the course is to avoid thinking categorically** about the ==biology== of behaviour [i]. The lecture critiques the tendency to put explanations into "buckets" (e.g., endocrinology, anatomy, evolutionary biology), which leads to problems like overemphasising one's own "bucket" as the sole explanation [i]. Instead, the course will take an **integrated approach**, continually examining how body and brain influence each other [i]. Each level of explanation (hormones, genes, environment) is viewed as a "temporary platform" or a convenient way to describe the outcome of all prior influences, resisting the urge for a single, isolated explanation [i].

Historical examples of "pathological categorical thinking" leading to immense damage include [i]:

- **John Watson (Behaviourism)**: Believed he could train any child to be anything by environmental control, a view now understood as pathologically limited due to biological factors [i].
- **Egas Moniz (Frontal Lobotomies)**: Invented lobotomies, leading to the destruction of hundreds of thousands of healthy brains, believing in "synaptic adjustments" to cure mental disorders [i].
- **Konrad Lorenz (Ethology/Nazi Propagandist)**: A founder of ethology, known for imprinting, also advocated for "extermination of elements of the population loaded with dregs" based on flawed "racial ideas" [i].

#### 4. Three Intellectual Challenges in Human Behavioural Biology

When studying human behaviour, three types of circumstances are considered [i]:

- **Humans are just like other animals**: Situations where human behaviour is identical to other species (e.g., menstrual/ovulatory synchrony via pheromones) [i].
- **Similar physiology, different use**: Humans use typical physiology in profoundly unique ways not seen in other animals (e.g., stress from abstract concepts, compassion for distant strangers) [i].
- **Unique human behaviour**: Actions with no remote parallel in the animal kingdom (e.g., non-reproductive sex, talking about sex, language) [i].

#### 5. Evolutionary Principles Applied to Behaviour

The application of Darwinian principles to behaviour forms a core part of the course [i]. This field is broadly known as **sociobiology**, emerging in the mid-1970s, and later giving birth to **evolutionary psychology** by the late 1980s. The notion is that behaviour and internal psychological states cannot be understood outside the context of evolution.

**Basic Darwinian Evolution**:

- **Evolution (Traits Change Over Time)**: Darwin did not discover evolution, but he did come up with the mechanism: **natural selection**.
- **Heritable Traits**: Traits can be passed on from one generation to the next, often translated as genetic traits.
- **Variability**: Different versions of these heritable traits exist.
- **Adaptiveness/Fitness**: Some versions of traits are more adaptive and confer more "fitness," leading to greater reproduction. It's about **reproduction, not just survival** – the number of gene copies left in the next generation.
- **Mutation**: Random introduction of new traits.

When these elements combine, populations evolve, and trait frequencies change. Applying this to behaviour means that behaviours are seen as heritable, variable, and subject to selection based on their adaptiveness. A significant, "incendiary issue" for the course will be the question of "how genetic behaviour is".

**Caveat on Personification**: Using phrases like "what would a female chimpanzee want to do" is a shorthand for describing behaviours sculpted by evolutionary exigencies, not conscious planning or desire.

#### 6. Debunking "Animals Behave for the Good of the Species"

A crucial concept to unlearn is the "worst urban myth of evolution": that animals behave for the good of the species. This notion, pushed by Wynne-Edwards in the early 1960s (known as "group selection"), is reviled in evolutionary biology. Instead, **animals behave for passing on as many copies of their genes as possible**.

The lecture uses the example of wildebeest migrating across a crocodile-infested river. The traditional National Geographic narrative of an elderly wildebeest sacrificing itself for the herd is debunked; in reality, the elderly wildebeest is often being **pushed from behind** by the others, trying to save themselves.

#### 7. Three Building Blocks of Contemporary Evolutionary Theory for Social Behaviour

Replacing the "group selection" idea, the lecture introduces three ways animals maximise the number of gene copies left in the next generation:

**a) Individual Selection**:

- This refers to an animal optimising the number of gene copies it leaves by **reproducing itself**.
- It's about maximising one's own reproductive success.
- **Natural Selection**: Traits aid leaving copies of genes outside of mere sexual preference (e.g., speed to escape predators).
- **Sexual Selection**: Traits chosen by the opposite sex, even if they have no survival value (e.g., big, green, paisley antlers on a male moose just because females like them). Sexual and natural selection can sometimes pull in opposite directions.

**b) Kin Selection (Inclusive Fitness)**:

- Animals maximise gene copies by **helping relatives reproduce**, because relatives share genes.
- The closer the relation, the more genes are shared (e.g., identical twins 100%, full siblings 50%, half siblings 25%).
- Geneticist Haldane famously quipped, "I will gladly lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins," illustrating the mathematical basis of relatedness.
- Evolution selects for cooperation with relatives.
- **Evidence**: Vervet monkeys demonstrate awareness of kinship, looking at a mother when her infant makes an alarm call, and even displacing revenge to a relative of the individual who caused harm.

**c) Reciprocal Altruism**:

- This involves **cooperation and altruistic behaviour among non-relatives**, but under strict constraints of reciprocation.
- It's not merely a stalemate or "rock-paper-scissors" scenario where parties avoid damage. True cooperation provides synergistic benefits (e.g., cooperative hunting).
- **Requirements**: Animals need to be smart (to remember who owes whom a favour), social, and long-lived enough to establish repeated interactions. Though most readily seen in "big, smart, long-lived social beasts," it can occur in bacteria and fungi.
- **Cheating**: A key facet is the intrinsic motivation to cheat when possible and the corresponding need to be vigilant against cheaters. Humans and chimps are remarkably better at detecting cheating than spontaneous acts of kindness.
- **Game Theory**: This mathematical framework studies optimal strategies in "games" of cooperation and defection.
    - **Prisoner's Dilemma**: The "fruit fly of game theory". It outlines four outcomes: both cooperate, both cheat, one cheats while the other cooperates (highest payoff for the cheater), or one cooperates while the other cheats (worst payoff for the cooperator).
    - **Axelrod's Tournament (1970s)**: Economist Robert Axelrod ran computer simulations where various strategies played the Prisoner's Dilemma against each other. The winning strategy was **Tit for Tat**.
        - **Tit for Tat**: Start by cooperating. If the other cooperates, continue cooperating. If they cheat, cheat back in the next round. If they return to cooperating, you return to cooperating. It is "nice, retaliatory, forgiving, and clear cut". "Tit for Tat may lose the battles, but it wins all the wars," driving other strategies into extinction.
        - **Vulnerability to Signal Error**: Tit for Tat is vulnerable to miscommunication, where a cooperative act is perceived as cheating, leading to a "seesaw" of mutual defection.
        - **Forgiving Tit for Tat**: Introduced to overcome signal error vulnerability. It follows Tit for Tat but has a rule to occasionally forgive and re-establish cooperation after a string of mutual defections. This strategy out-competes standard Tit for Tat when signal errors are possible.
        - **Exploitation Vulnerability**: Forgiving Tit for Tat can be exploited by strategies that don't forgive.
        - **Trust-Based Strategy**: A more robust strategy involves starting with Tit for Tat and, after a sufficient number of cheat-free rounds, switching to Forgiving Tit for Tat (i.e., deciding to trust the other individual).
        - **Pavlov**: Another strategy where if an action yields a reward, it's repeated; if it leads to a loss, the strategy switches. Pavlov can exploit forgiving strategies.
- **Real-World Evidence of Game Theory in Animals**:
    - **Vampire Bats**: Females in communal nests share blood. When a researcher faked a female's full throat sack with air (simulating cheating), other females subsequently refused to feed her offspring – an exact "Tit for Tat" response to a "signal error".
    - **Stickleback Fish**: These fish can be made to exhibit Tit for Tat behaviour through mirror manipulation, responding to perceived "cheating" by their reflection.
    - **Black Hamlet Fish**: These gender-changing fish take turns being male and female. The one paying more (female) will stop cooperating if the other cheats by being male too often.
- **Real-World Complications (Exceptions)**:
    - **Lions**: Some lions are "scaredy cats" and avoid approaching threats without punishment, suggesting that animals aren't always perfectly optimising. This can be due to "simultaneous games" where other cooperative behaviours balance out the "cheating" in another domain.
    - **Naked Mole Rats**: Colonies sometimes have large, non-working individuals who are not punished. These "lazy" rats, however, plug tunnels during the rainy season, demonstrating "role diversification" and simultaneous games.
- **James Holland**: Developed computer models to study strategy mutations, showing how they spread or are driven to extinction, bridging game theory and biological modelling.

#### 8. Application to Species Classification: Tournament vs. Pair-Bonding Species

Using these principles, one can predict social behaviour by merely looking at skull size differences between males and females. This leads to a dichotomy in social mammals:

**a) Tournament Species**:

- **Characteristics**: Males significantly larger than females (high sexual dimorphism).
- **Male Behaviour**: Higher levels of aggression. Massive variability in male reproductive success (e.g., 95% of reproduction by 5% of males). Males do not engage in parental behaviour.
- **Female Choice**: Females choose for "big, hunky guys" or signs of health (e.g., peacock feathers), as they only get genes from the male.
- **Life Span**: Significant difference in life expectancy by gender, with males having shorter lives due to energy expenditure, high testosterone, and injuries from aggression.
- **Twinning/Cuckoldry**: Females rarely give birth to twins (as they are single mothers), and do not cuckold (abandon offspring) as there's no male to take over parental care.
- **Examples**: Savanna baboons (males twice as big as females), peacocks, chickens with pecking orders.

**b) Pair-Bonding (Monogamous) Species**:

- **Characteristics**: Males and females are the same size (low sexual dimorphism).
- **Male Behaviour**: Low levels of aggression. Low variability in male reproductive success (every male has 1-2 kids). Males engage in significant parental behaviour ("soccer dads").
- **Female Choice**: Females choose males for "good personality," ability to express emotions, and parental competence, seeking a male "as close to a female as you can get to" without lactation.
- **Life Span**: No significant difference in life expectancy by gender.
- **Twinning/Cuckoldry**: Females often give birth to twins (because there are two parents) and have a higher rate of cuckoldry (abandoning offspring) as the male takes care of them.
- **Examples**: South American marmosets and tamarins.

#### 9. Humans: A Confused Middle Ground

Humans are not a classic tournament species nor a classic pair-bonding one; **we are somewhere in the middle** on measures like sexual dimorphism, reproductive variability, life span, and parental behaviour. This "terribly confused" position explains much about human social structures. While most people currently live in monogamous cultures, historically, most cultures allowed polygamy. Even in polygamous cultures, the majority of individuals were pair-bonded. Polygamy can be driven by economic factors (wealthiest men having multiple wives) or demographic factors (shortage of males, e.g., in warrior classes).

The lecture concludes by stating that these principles (individual selection, kin selection, reciprocal altruism) are powerful tools for understanding animal behaviour, including complex actions like killing other members of one's species, which traditional "good of the species" views could not explain.
