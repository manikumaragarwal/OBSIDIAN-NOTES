[[Can "Tara" be read as a 'disability text'? | ASSIGNMENT]]
## Bharti's Disability
- She literally cannot speak the truth about what happened in the hospital.
- She knew the truth but was rendered powerless by patriarchal structures
- Disabled motherhood, can't protect, or be honest with her daughter.
- She in internally just as disabled as tara. 
## Patel's Disability
- His inability to see women's as equal as son's.
- His inability to take responsibility: He cannot confess, apologize, or face consequences.
- Emotionally disabled in a way, He Cannot express love, remorse, or genuine connection with his children.

## Tara's Disability

- Her body was deliberately sacrificed, in hopes her brother would have a better life.
- Disabled agency: she was robbed of her own story, never got to know the truth about her body.

## Dan's Disability
- At first, he recieved 'better' body part, which later becomes the source of his trauma.
- Unable to forgive himself or his parents 
- is entire identity is built on a violence, he didn't even agree to in the first place.
- He is running away from his past, his story. 
## Society's Disability
- Dr. Thakkar can be bribed; medical decisions based on gender, not medical need 
- No accountability for what is essentially gender-based violence
- Language Disability, what word would YOu use to what happpend to tara? Assault?  Medical malpractice. 

The family is stuck in the past, we see this through dan's way of writing the play. with constant flashbacks. 

Okay, so This is quote I stole form somewhere.. "you cannot separate Tara's disability from her being female"


*And who decides what's good for us to hear and what isn't?*

*Whatever it is, if at all it exists, he will tell us himself when he thinks we are **good and ready***
