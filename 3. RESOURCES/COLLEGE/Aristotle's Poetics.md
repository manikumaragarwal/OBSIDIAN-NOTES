# PLOT

- A good plot has - Begining Middle End.

- Begining : **Rising Action** (Complication)
- End : **Falling Action** (unravelling or Denouement)

[[3 Tragic Beats]] :
1. **Peripeteia** : A sudden reversal of fortune.
2. **Anagnorisis** : When a character makes a critical discovery.
3. **Catharsis** : The emotional relief in an audience.


### Causality
Compelling stories should have scenes with clear **Cause** and **Effects** between each other.

- Each plot point builds on top of another, untill the ultimate climax.
[[Three Act Structure]]
- If any one scene is displayed or removed, the whole would be disjointed and Disturbed. 
- For a thing whose presence or absence makes no visible difference, is not an organic part of the whole.
- **Episodic**: The world aristotle uses, for stories which doesn't have causality.

### Unity of Action
Story should revolve around a single Drive. 
-  Unity of Action does not.. consist in the unity of hero,   For infinitely various are the incidents in one man's life which cannot be reduced to unity.
	- Every character can have multiple roles, but sticking to one of these goals, is crucial to a good story.
