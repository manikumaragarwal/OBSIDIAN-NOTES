## Questions to follow : 
- Why did the Authors write the "Dicing Scene" in Mahabharata, the way they did ? 
	- Look at The content of the Epic
	- Narrative Techniques of the Author



# Interesting Ideas : 

>  "==Defeat is seldom attributed to any flaw in Yudhisthira's Character=="

- This is saying that when Yudhisthira experiences defeat or failure, people **rarely blame it on any personal weakness or character defect** of his.
- Despite these failures, admirers and interpreters of the epic tend to:
	- Blame external factors (the loaded dice, his enemies' trickery)
	- Attribute it to fate or dharma being tested
	- See it as situational rather than a character flaw 
> "in order to win, deceit must be countered with deceit, virtue gives
way to vengeance, and the prize is not worth the winning"
##### Why it is Hard to see Pandava as Heroes (especially Yudhisthira)
1.  Yudhisthira finally let go of his Righteousness in the Final battle. (Aswathama incident.)
2. Yudhisthira didnt' follow his Kshatriya dharma (to fight and protect the weak). He didn't intervene to save draupadi.   

> [!NOTE]
> His ***self-control*** and ***punctilious adherence*** to his interpretation of dharma when his wife is in danger seems to contrast oddly with the impulsiveness which has placed her in that predicament.

### Draupadi was menstruating. 
- In those time, Menstruation = pollution. 
- Draupadi did not wanted to come to the hall, because she was mentruating... and her presence will pollute the men in the hall..     
- her refusal to go voluntarily is the act, not of a defiant harridan, but of a pious woman anxious to protect her male relatives.

> [!How Kaurava Defiled themselves, when they were Assaulting Draupadi]
> >   Even after knowing that Draupadi is menstruating, Dhartarastra(sons of Driritrastra - **Kaurava**) still talked, touched, and solicited sexual favours from Draupadi...   * Kaurava **Defiled** themselves*

> [!Why did Yudhisthira didn't speak when Draupadi was being assaulted]
> > Yudhisthira loves Draupadi too much, for her to become the wife of dishonered men (which Pandava would also become if they talked in front of Draupadi??? WTF)
>  - after he found out Draupadi is menstruating, he didn't react, as to keep the purity of himself and his brothers.
>  > *Whether this purity is to be understood as having some kind of active, magical protective force, or as a narrative metaphor for the Pândavas' straightforward moral superiority over the Dhärtarästras, it is clear that **Yudhisthira is great, not despite his inactivity, but because of it***.
