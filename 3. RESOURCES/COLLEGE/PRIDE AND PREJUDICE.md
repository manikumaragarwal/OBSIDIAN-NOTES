# CRITICAL COMMENTARIES
##### IRONY throughout the novel - 
1. "Everyone knows that a single rich man is looking for a wife"  is an irony.  
	- In reality, "Every single rich man knows, he is to be persuaded by women, who want to be his wife".
2. In a novel, about couple overcoming misunderstandings to achieve a marital status, the first view of marriage is an mismatched couple, who can't communicate.
	- Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are polar opposites to each other:  Mr. Bennet is a dry witted man, who uses sarcasms throughout the novel, and Mrs. Bennet misses all those mocking tones.
3. Elizabeth criticises Jane for being blind, that she see's good in other people as a reflection her own heart. That she should be more careful.
	- It's ironic how Elizabeth is herself blinded by appearances, and prejudice.




### Elizabeth is an exception from the women in her times
1. Elizabeth is quick witted, confident, and intelligent.
	- during her times, girl were a little introverted, less spoken. but Elizabeth is sharp with her words, she is quick witted, and she knows how to defend herself in a conversation.
2. Elizabeth enjoys physical activity, especially walking.
	- when Elizabeth easily walks 3 miles to visit her sick sister, caroline bingley's snide response shows that this behaviour was not common amoung gentlewomen of her time.
