I think yes, Mahesh Dattani's "Tara" can definitely be studied as a disability text, though maybe not in the way we usually think about disability. The play does center on physical disability, Tara's mutilated body after the separation surgery, but I feel like it uses this disability more as a vehicle to explore something deeper. It's really about how patriarchy disables everyone it touches, not just physically, but emotionally, morally, and psychologically too.

## Disability as a Vehicle, Not Just the Main Point

What strikes me is that "Tara" deals less with physical disability and more with metaphorical disability, if that makes sense. The separation surgery that leaves Tara with only one leg is like this literal, physical representation of how society mutilates its daughters. There's this idea that really hit me, **you cannot separate Tara's disability from her being female.** Her disability isn't some random medical accident, it's a deliberate act of gender-based violence. Her father planned it, a doctor took a bribe to do it. So I think this makes the play a disability text that you npu separate from its critique of patriarchy, they're completely intertwined.

t## Tara's Disability Works on So Many Levels

I think Tara's disability operates on multiple levels. Obviously yes, she has a mutilated body, her body was literally sacrificed so her brother could have "a better life." But beyond just the physical part, she suffers from what I'd call disabled agency, she was robbed of her own story. Nobody ever told her the truth about what was done to her body. She just lived her entire life not knowing that her father chose to give her brother the better body parts, that her suffering was planned, calculated, that money changed hands for this to happen.

This creates a disabled future for her too, her marriage prospects, her independence, even her sense of self, it's all built on a lie. When she finally learns the truth, she realizes she's been "cheated" her whole life. I can't imagine what that must feel like.

## Bharti's Disability Might Be the Most Tragic

I feel like Bharti's disability is maybe the most tragic because it's completely invisible. She literally cannot speak the truth about what happened in the hospital. Like, she knew everything, she knew her husband bribed the doctor, she knew Tara was deliberately mutilated, but she was just rendered powerless by patriarchal structures. She couldn't do anything.

This is what I think of as disabled motherhood, she cannot protect her daughter or be honest with her. Her migraine headaches throughout the play, I think those are psychosomatic, like her body is physically showing what it feels like to carry this terrible secret. She is internally just as disabled as Tara, cut and silenced by the same system that mutilated her daughter's body.

## Patel's Moral Disability

Patel is interesting to me because he has what I'd call moral disability, this fundamental inability to see women as equal to sons. He made this calculated decision to sacrifice his daughter for his son and he rationalized it through patriarchal logic, "What life would the boy have had?" That question alone reveals his deeper disability, the inability to even imagine that Tara's life holds equal value.

But I think Patel is also emotionally disabled. He cannot express love, remorse, or any genuine connection with his children. His inability to take responsibility, to confess, to apologize, to face any consequences, it ultimately destroys his relationship with both Tara and Dan. He is a father who actively harmed his child and then imprisoned his entire family in silence just to protect himself. That's pretty messed up.

## Dan's Psychological Disability Is Complex

Dan's case is particularly complex, I think. At first, he received the "better" body parts, three legs to Tara's one, but this becomes the source of his deepest trauma. He suffers from survivor's guilt, knowing he lives in a body "stolen" from his sister. His entire identity is built on violence he didn't even consent to but directly benefits from. How do you live with that?

He can't forgive himself or his parents, so Dan is just psychologically paralyzed. The play's structure itself actually mirrors this, all those constant flashbacks show us a narrator who's stuck in the past, unable to move forward. He is literally running away from his story, from his family, from himself, living in London but emotionally still trapped in that hospital room where the surgery happened.

## Society Itself Is Disabled

The play also shows how society itself is disabled, I think. Dr. Thakkar can just be bribed to make medical decisions based on gender rather than actual medical need. There is no accountability for what is essentially gender-based violence, no legal consequences, no social outcry, nothing.

Maybe most telling is what I'd call language disability, what word would you even use for what happened to Tara? Assault? Medical malpractice? Mutilation? The fact that we struggle to name it shows how our language itself is disabled when it comes to recognizing gender-based violence. We don't even have the right words.

## Everyone's Just Stuck

The entire family is stuck in the past, unable to move forward. We see this through Dan's way of telling the story, through constant flashbacks, through his inability to narrate linearly. This temporal paralysis is itself a form of disability, they cannot grow, cannot heal, cannot escape the moment of that surgery. The secret has literally frozen them all in time.

## So Why Is "Tara" a Disability Text?

I think "Tara" qualifies as a disability text because it shows us that **disability doesn't only trouble you physically, but more mentally.** Every single character in this play is disabled by what happened in that hospital:

- Tara is physically mutilated and psychologically betrayed
- Dan is psychologically traumatized and morally paralyzed
- Bharati is emotionally imprisoned and silenced
- Patel is morally stunted and spiritually empty
- Society is ethically corrupt and structurally violent

The separation surgery becomes this metaphor for how patriarchy separates, mutilates, and disables everyone, not just the daughters it directly harms, but the sons it privileges, the mothers it silences, the fathers it corrupts, and the society that allows it all to happen.

## My Conclusion, I Guess

So yes, I think "Tara" can and should be studied as a disability text. But it's a text that expands what we think disability means, if that makes sense. It shows us that disability is not just about bodies, but about systems. It's not just physical, but psychological, moral, and social.

Most importantly, I feel like it shows us that **patriarchy is deeply ingrained through the narrative as this force that disables everyone it touches**, some visibly, some invisibly, but all profoundly.

The play uses the vehicle of disability to explore gender discrimination and gender-based violence, proving that in a patriarchal society, you cannot separate a woman's disability from her being female. Tara's mutilated body is not just a medical condition, it is the physical manifestation of a society's violence against its daughters. That's what makes this play so powerful, I think.


So yes, I think "tara" can and should be studies as a disability text. But it's a text that expands what we think disability means if that makes sense.
