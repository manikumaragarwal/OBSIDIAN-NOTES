## SECTION 1: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen

### Key Themes & Critical Analysis

#### 1. **Pemberley Estate & Elizabeth's Perception of Darcy**

**Critical Points:**

- **Symbolic Significance**: Pemberley represents Darcy's true character - well-managed, tasteful, harmonious
- **Elizabeth's Transformation**: The estate visit marks a turning point in her prejudice
- **Housekeeper's Testimony**: Mrs. Reynolds' praise adds credible perspective
- **Natural vs. Artificial**: The estate's natural beauty contrasts with Lady Catherine's ostentatious Rosings
- **Class & Taste**: Demonstrates that wealth combined with taste and responsibility is admirable

**Key Quotation**: "She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste" (Volume III, Chapter 1)

**Exam Strategy**: Discuss how physical spaces reflect character, the role of material possessions in revealing moral worth, and Elizabeth's evolving judgment.

---

#### 2. **The 'Accomplished' Woman**

**Three Key Characters to Analyze:**

**Elizabeth Bennet:**

- Challenges conventional expectations
- Values intelligence and wit over mere "accomplishments"
- Represents Austen's ideal: substance over superficiality
- Quote: "A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing...and to all this she must yet add something more substantial"

**Caroline Bingley:**

- Embodies superficial accomplishment
- Uses "accomplishments" as competitive tools
- Represents artificiality and social climbing

**Georgiana Darcy:**

- Possesses technical skills but lacks confidence
- Shows accomplishments without Elizabeth's intellectual independence
- Represents incomplete development

**Critical Framework:**

- Austen critiques the reduction of women to ornamental objects
- Novel questions what truly makes a woman "accomplished"
- Marriage market dynamics pressure women into performative accomplishments

---

#### 3. **Irony & Social Critique**

**Types of Irony in P&P:**

**Verbal Irony**:

- Opening line: "It is a truth universally acknowledged..."
- Mr. Bennet's sardonic comments

**Dramatic Irony**:

- Reader knows Darcy loves Elizabeth before she does
- Wickham's true character vs. his charming appearance

**Situational Irony**:

- Darcy, accused of pride, shows humility
- Elizabeth, who values discernment, is fooled by Wickham

**Social Critique Through Irony:**

- **Mr. Collins**: Comic representation of clerical sycophancy and inherited privilege
- **Lady Catherine**: Aristocratic arrogance exposed as empty pomposity
- **Mrs. Bennet**: Marriage-market obsession shown as both comic and tragic
- **Entailment System**: Absurdity of property laws affecting women

**Exam Approach**: Show how Austen uses humor to make serious points about gender, class, and social institutions more palatable and penetrating.

## SECTION 2: NARRATOLOGY

### Gerald Prince's Framework

#### **Collection of Signs in Narrative**

**Two Major Categories:**

1. **Signs of the Narrated** (the story content)
    
    - Events
    - Characters
    - Settings
    - Temporal markers
2. **Signs of Narrating** (how the story is told)
    
    - Narrator presence/voice
    - Narratee (implied reader)
    - Perspective/focalization
    - Temporal ordering

**Key Concepts to Master:**

**Narrator Types:**

- First-person narrators (character-narrators)
- Third-person narrators (external narrators)
- Reliable vs. unreliable narrators

**Narrator Qualities:**

- **Intrusiveness**: How overtly present is the narrator?
- **Self-consciousness**: Does narrator acknowledge storytelling act?
- **Reliability**: Can we trust the narrator?
- **Distance**: Temporal, emotional, or moral distance from events

**Example Analysis Framework:**

- Identify the narrative voice
- Analyze signs of the "I" (even when not explicit)
- Examine how narrative choices shape meaning
- Consider reader-narrator relationship

## SECTION 3: TARA by Mahesh Dattani

### Critical Analysis Framework

#### 1. **Roopa as Representation of Societal Apathy**

**Key Points:**

**Lack of Empathy Manifestations:**

- Curiosity about disability without genuine care
- Acceptance of bribes from Bharati to befriend Tara
- Represents neighborhood/society's voyeuristic cruelty
- The poster: "We don't want freaks"

**Symbolic Function:**

- Embodies normalized discrimination
- Represents internalized patriarchy even in young girls
- Shows how society Others the disabled

**Critical Perspective:**

- Roopa is both victim and perpetrator of social conditioning
- Her character reveals how discrimination is taught and learned
- Connects to larger themes of gender discrimination

**Exam Strategy**: Link Roopa's behavior to:

- Social construction of normalcy
- Intersection of gender and disability discrimination
- How society fails both Tara and girls like Roopa

---

#### 2. **Stage Design & Stylistics**

**Multi-Level Stage Structure:**

**Three Distinct Spaces:**

1. **Dan's London Apartment** (Present/Frame narrative)
    
    - Writerly space of recollection
    - Meta-theatrical element
    - Connects past and present
2. **Dr. Thakkar's Space** (Elevated)
    
    - "God-like presence"
    - Symbolic of medical authority
    - Physical elevation = moral judgment
    - Critiques misuse of medical power
3. **Patel House/Galli** (Lower level)
    
    - Domestic space
    - Memory space
    - Where trauma occurred
    - Most of action happens here

**Technical Elements:**

- **Cross-lighting**: Suggests different spaces/times simultaneously
- **Fluidity**: Scenes flow without traditional act breaks
- **Non-naturalistic**: Challenges realistic theatre conventions
- **Memory structure**: Stage design reflects psychological space

**Dattani's Innovation:**

- Rejects proscenium realism
- Incorporates Indian theatrical traditions
- Stage becomes metaphor for layers of truth
- Simultaneous action shows multiple perspectives

**Exam Approach**: Discuss how physical space reinforces thematic content, how elevation/levels create hierarchy and judgment, and how stage design enables temporal fluidity.

## SECTION 4: POETRY ANALYSIS

### "Composed Upon Westminster Bridge" - Wordsworth

#### **Meter and Rhyme Analysis**

**Form**: Italian (Petrarchan) Sonnet

- 14 lines
- Iambic pentameter
- Rhyme scheme: ABBA ABBA CDC DCD

**Quoted Lines Analysis:**

```
This City now doth, like a garment, wear (A)
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, (B)
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie (B)
Open unto the fields, and to the sky; (A)
```

**Metrical Analysis:**

- Regular iambic pentameter (unstressed-stressed pattern)
- Creates sense of calm contemplation
- Occasional variations add emphasis
- Example: "SHIPS, TOWers, DOMES, theAtres, and TEmples"

**Rhyme Function:**

- ABBA structure creates enclosed feeling (appropriate for city)
- Perfect rhymes suggest harmony and order
- Sestet's CDC DCD shows resolution/acceptance

**Romantic Elements:**

- Nature and city harmonized
- Sublime experience
- Emotional response to landscape
- Morning = renewal, innocence

**Critical Points:**

- Unusual for Wordsworth to celebrate urban setting
- City peaceful because people are absent/asleep
- "Like a garment" simile: beauty is temporary covering
- "Silent, bare" - city stripped of commerce and noise
- List of structures democratized (no hierarchy)

**Exam Strategy**: Connect form to content - how does the sonnet structure enhance meaning? Why does Wordsworth choose this traditionally love-poem form for a cityscape?

### "341 After Great Pain" - Emily Dickinson

#### **Singular vs. Fixed Meaning**

**Argument FOR Multiple Meanings:**

**Textual Evidence:**

- Sparse punctuation allows varied readings
- Ambiguous pronouns ("He")
- Metaphorical language open to interpretation
- Gaps and silences invite reader participation

**Dickinson's Style:**

- Deliberately cryptic
- Personal symbolism
- Compression creates ambiguity
- Dashes create pause/possibility

**Reader Response Theory:**

- Different readers bring different experiences
- Historical context changes interpretation
- Emotional states affect reading

**Argument FOR Some Fixed Meaning:**

**Shared Human Experience:**

- Grief is universal
- Physical descriptions of numbness recognizable
- Progression through trauma follows pattern
- Cultural understanding of pain

**Structural Clues:**

- Three stages clearly marked
- Central metaphor of freezing to death
- Internal logic of progression
- Formal hour measurement

**Critical Approach for Exam:**

**Balanced Argument:**

1. Acknowledge poem's openness
2. Identify elements that remain stable
3. Discuss how ambiguity serves theme
4. Consider intentional vs. unintentional meanings

**Key Analysis Points:**

**Stanza 1: Immediate Aftermath**

- "formal feeling" - oxymoron suggests numbness
- "Nerves sit ceremonious" - personification of shock
- Question of time (yesterday/centuries) - trauma disrupts temporality

**Stanza 2: Mechanical Survival**

- "mechanical" - automatic functioning
- "Wooden way" - loss of vitality
- "Quartz contentment" - hard, mineral = not human comfort

**Stanza 3: Stages of Processing**

- "Hour of Lead" - weight of grief
- Comparison to freezing: Chill → Stupor → Letting go
- Progression toward acceptance or death?

**Ambiguities to Discuss:**

- Who is "He"? (God, Christ, deceased, doctor, abstract pain)
- What is the "great pain"? (death, loss, betrayal, existence)
- Is "letting go" acceptance or death?
- Is this personal or universal experience?

**Theoretical Framework:**

- **New Criticism**: Close reading of text's internal meanings
- **Reader-Response**: How readers co-create meaning
- **Biographical**: Dickinson's reclusion and losses
- **Feminist**: Women's experiences of pain and silencing

## SECTION 5: DRAMA THEORY

### Watson's "The Nature of Drama"

**Key Points for Short Note:**

**Definition:** Drama as "representation of carefully selected actions by living people on stage in front of an audience"

**Essential Elements:**

1. **Theatricality** (performance aspect)
2. **Actors** (embodiment)
3. **Concentrated Action** (intensity)
4. **Audience** (communal reception)

**Historical Development:**

- Origins in ritual and religious observance
- Greek: Amphitheater, unity of action
- Elizabethan: Thrust stage, flexibility
- Naturalism: Fourth wall, realism
- Modern: Breaking conventions

**Drama vs. Other Literary Forms:**

- **Selectivity**: Must condense (time limits)
- **Physicality**: Visual and aural dimensions
- **Immediacy**: Present-tense experience
- **Collaborative**: Writer-director-actor-audience

**Key Concepts:**

**Plot and Action:**

- Five-part structure (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution)
- Aristotelian unities (time, place, action) - followed or subverted

**Language:**

- Dramatic dialogue must multitask
- Reveals character, advances plot, creates atmosphere
- More "energetic" than everyday speech
- Prose and poetry both valid

**Physicality:**

- Stage design affects meaning
- Movement, gesture, costume
- Sound, music, silence
- Visual symbolism

**Reading vs. Seeing:**

- Drama exists in two forms (text and performance)
- Reading requires imaginative staging
- Performance interprets text

### Tanvir's "It Must Flow: A Life in Theatre"

**European Influence on Tanvir:**

**What He Learned Abroad:**

**Technical Skills:**

- RADA and Bristol Old Vic Theatre School
- Stagecraft, mask-making
- Production techniques
- Duncan Ross's lesson: "Production is telling a story"

**Bertolt Brecht's Impact:**

- **Minimalist stage décor**: Remove unnecessary elements
- **Alienation effect**: Make audience think, not just feel
- **Social commentary**: Theatre as political tool
- **Folk elements**: Accessibility to common people
- **Anti-naturalism**: Break fourth wall

**Cultural Realization:**

- Europe taught him he belonged to India
- Language and culture are intrinsically linked
- "If you're dealing with words and cultures, you belong where you come from"

**Movement and Language Connection:**

- Western movement doesn't suit Indian languages
- Each language has its own physicality
- This led to using Chhattisgarhi actors with natural movements

**How Europe Influenced Street Theatre Form:**

**1. Minimalist Aesthetic:**

- Brecht's sparse stage design
- Easy to set up anywhere
- Focus on performance, not spectacle

**2. Political Theatre:**

- Theatre as tool for social change
- Accessible to masses, not just elite
- Direct engagement with contemporary issues

**3. Anti-Elitism:**

- Rejection of "high culture" vs "low culture" binary
- Folk forms given equal dignity
- Language democratization (dialects vs. chaste Hindi/Urdu)

**4. Synthesis:**

- Combined European techniques with Indian forms
- Nacha theatre + Brechtian principles
- Created unique Naya Theatre aesthetic

**Tanvir's Innovations Post-Europe:**

**Agra Bazaar (1953):**

- First major synthesis
- Nazir's poetry for common people
- Mix of professional and non-professional actors
- Colloquial language

**Chhattisgarhi Folk Actors:**

- Brought back after Mitti ki Gadi struggle
- Let them use natural movements and language
- Improvisation encouraged
- Created authentic, powerful performances

**Street Theatre Characteristics:**

- Portable, minimal sets
- Direct audience engagement
- Mix of song, dance, dialogue (from Nacha)
- Social and political content
- Accessible language

**Key Productions:**

- **Charandas Chor** (1974): Won Fringe First Award in Edinburgh despite language barrier
- **Gaon ka Naam Sasural**: Tested in villages first
- **Shajapur ki Shantibai**: Adapted Brecht to Indian context

**Philosophy:**

- "It Must Flow" - don't let anything interrupt story
- Rasa (aesthetic essence) is only unity needed
- Theatre should disturb and educate
- Folk and classical traditions equally valid

**Exam Strategy**: Discuss how Tanvir's European experience paradoxically led him to embrace Indian forms, creating a unique synthesis that challenged both Western and Indian theatrical conventions.

## SECTION 6: CLASS - Gary Day

### Key Concepts

**Historical Evolution of "Class":**

**Roman Origins:**

- Latin: _classis_ (division of people by estates and age)
- Created patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (common people)
- Established concept of social hierarchy

**Medieval Christian Interpretation:**

- St. Augustine: Division originated in Biblical Fall
- Society as body with interconnected parts
- Three estates: Nobles, Clergy, Common people
- "Order" and "station" as organizing concepts
- Divinely sanctioned hierarchy

**17th Century Changes:**

- Word "class" enters English
- Rise of capitalism changes social relations
- "Class" implies conflict vs. "order" implies harmony
- Growth of Puritan work ethic
- Material wealth as divine reward

**Marx's Revolutionary Definition (19th Century):**

**Two Classes:**

1. **Bourgeoisie**: Own means of production (factories, land, capital)
2. **Proletariat**: Own only labor power

**Key Marxist Concepts:**

**Social Relations of Production:**

- Ownership vs. non-ownership defines class
- Economic structure determines politics, law, culture
- Class consciousness develops through conflict

**Surplus Value:**

- Worker creates value beyond cost of inputs + labor
- Capitalist keeps surplus as profit
- Exploitation is systematic, not exceptional
- Example: Worker paid ₹100, creates product sold for ₹400 (input ₹100, surplus ₹200)

**Historical Materialism:**

- "History of all hitherto existing society is history of class struggles"
- Economic base determines superstructure
- Class conflict drives social change

**Class vs. Status (Weber's Distinction):**

**Class (Economic):**

- Position in market
- Property ownership
- Relationship to production

**Status (Social):**

- Honor, prestige
- Lifestyle and consumption
- Group membership and identity
- Can have high status but be poor

**Modern Complications:**

- Middle class: Status-based identity, production-based reality
- Working class: Both status and economic definition
- Internal divisions within classes
- Status consciousness can inhibit class consciousness

---

### Literature and Exchange

**Key Arguments:**

**1. Literature as Form of Representation:**

- Like money represents commodities
- But unlike money, not abstract
- Attends to particularity, not commonality

**2. Historical Development:**

- "Literature" from Latin _littera_ (letter)
- Originally meant literacy itself
- 18th century: Discernment of excellence
- 19th-20th century: Creative/imaginative works
- Embodiment of "British" identity

**3. Literature's Relationship to Exchange:**

**Sometimes Complementary:**

- Both emerged with capitalism
- Both are representational systems
- Both structure understanding of world

**Sometimes Contradictory:**

- Money abstracts; literature particularizes
- Exchange flattens; literature nuances
- Capitalism commodifies; literature humanizes

**4. Literature as Status Marker:**

- F.R. Leavis: Only elite minority can judge
- Creates cultural distinction
- Aligns with status groups
- Maintains hierarchies

**5. Literature as Class Ally/Enemy:**

- Can critique exchange relations
- Can naturalize capitalism
- Can resist commodification
- Can itself become commodity

## EXAM STRATEGIES

### Universal Human Values vs. Socio-Political Context

**How to Approach This Question:**

**1. Acknowledge the Tension:**

- Universal values exist (love, justice, death, suffering)
- But they're always expressed in specific contexts
- Literature mediates between universal and particular

**2. Use Two Texts as Examples:**

**Example 1: Pride and Prejudice**

- **Universal**: Love overcoming pride and prejudice
- **Particular**: 19th century English marriage market
- **Analysis**: Love is universal, but its expression shaped by property laws, gender roles, class system
- Austen shows universal human folly through specific social satire

**Example 2: Tara**

- **Universal**: Parental love, sibling bonds, guilt, loss
- **Particular**: Indian gender discrimination, medical ethics, disability stigma
- **Analysis**: Pain of injustice universal, but manifests through specific cultural prejudices
- Gender bias is culturally specific expression of universal power imbalances

**3. Argue That:**

- Literature's power comes from grounding universal in particular
- Can't separate "universal human values" from social/political context
- What we call "universal" often reflects dominant culture's values
- Great literature shows both: recognizable humanity AND specific conditions

---

### Writer's Dialogue with Genre

**Framework for Analysis:**

**1. Intertextuality:**

- Writers respond to predecessors
- Genre conventions provide framework to work within or against
- Allusions and revisions

**2. Choose One Text:**

**Example: Pride and Prejudice**

**Austen in Dialogue with:**

- **Samuel Richardson** (_Pamela_): Virtue rewarded, but Austen adds irony
- **Fanny Burney** (_Evelina_): Female education and social mobility
- **Courtship novel tradition**: Follows but subverts conventions
- **Gothic novels**: Parodies in _Northanger Abbey_, influenced realistic approach in P&P

**Specific Examples:**

- Marriage plot convention used but complicated
- Hero's transformation (Darcy) echoes Pamela's Mr. B, but psychological depth added
- Social comedy tradition elevated
- Ironic narrator responds to omniscient narrators
- "It is a truth universally acknowledged" parodies universal declarations in earlier novels

**3. Show How Dialogue Works:**

- Austen both uses and critiques genre conventions
- Creates expectations then subverts them
- Builds on predecessors while innovating
- Genre is living conversation, not fixed form
